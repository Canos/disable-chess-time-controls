### What is this about
*Disable chess time controls* is a charity and a free, libre, no-ads, open source extension.  

This extension was created with the idea of helping with chess study.  
Some of us lack the willpower and easily fall into the temptation of playing fast-paced games, which is the opposite of what many of us actually want.
This application helps set aside our temptation, stop procrastinating, and focus on what benefits us the most.

### Open Source 
The code of this extension is available for everyone on [github](https://github.com/Canos/disable-chess-time-controls).
The extension doesn't collect any data, can only read content from chess.com an lichess.org.
